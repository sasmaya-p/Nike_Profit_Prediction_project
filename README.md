# Nike_Profit_Prediction_project
The project’s aim is to clean and analyze the unprocessed Nike sales dataset to identify sales trends, top performing products, and regional demand patterns. Furthermore, the project aims to develop predictive models for sales forecasting, key factors for driving revenue, customer preferences, marketing, and strategic decision making.
Nike as one of the world’s leading sportswear brands generate vast amount of data across products, customers and regions. The dataset captures multiple aspects such as sales, customer profiles, pricing, patterns and discounts. By analyzing these details this project aims to discover what makes a customer choose one product over another? How do discounts or promotions change buying behaviour?
By extracting patterns and trends, this study seeks to build a framework for understanding consumer demand and predicting future sales. The findings will help Nike optimize product launches, improve marketing strategies, enhance customer satisfaction and strengthen its competitive advantage in the global sports wear industry.
Imagine a young athlete browsing Nike’s website searching for the latest running shoes also a fitness enthusiast shopping at a Nike store for premium sports wear. Or we can imagine a college student waiting for seasonal discounts to grab her favorite sneakers. Nike serves millions of customers like this everyday each with unique preferences, habits and budgets.
Our project uses Nikes real world sales and customer data to know which product gets more sales during discounts. Do this products have sales better in online or offline? What drives the choices of the customer? Are the motivated more by the branded value, prize cuts or product features? Who among men, woman and kids purchase most of the items from Nike?
